"""The tracking centre in the dialogs: a map marker, stored as two numbers.

Copied from Live Track Aircraft (its backlog 192, Lee 2026-10-18): the setup and options dialogs show the
centre as ONE map marker (Home Assistant's location selector, no radius
circle) and keep the radius as a number in kilometres.

The entry still stores CONF_LATITUDE and CONF_LONGITUDE as separate keys, so
existing entries, the coordinator, the title and the unique_id read exactly
what they read before. This module converts between the two shapes and does
nothing else. It imports nothing from Home Assistant, so the tests load it.

! THE SELECTOR DOES NOT RANGE-CHECK. Measured on HA 2026.10.2: its data schema
coerces both values to float and requires both keys, and a latitude of 141.9
passed. The range check is here.

! A ``radius`` key inside the location is IGNORED. The selector is configured
without one, but its data schema still accepts it, and the radius is
CONF_RADIUS_KM, a field of its own with its own limits.
